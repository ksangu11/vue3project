# Week 6
### Requirements
- [x] 4 Images
- [x] Use Vue framework/library
- [x] Add hover functionality to images
- [x] Page styling

### Additional Includes
- [x] Inclusion of 3 separate vue components
- [x] Used 8 photos
- [x] Addition of a button 

I was trying to get the photos to hover one at a time. I know the way I've done it is not specific enough and relies on the boolean @mouseover/@mouseleave like the Glitch example demonstrated. What would be the best way to achieve that when using multiple images?
